Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
I am really nore sure about the difference between fork and brach ... Fork most probably gives the complete copy for a experimental change. BUt I think the same can be done with branching also so what is the difference.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
That means I am updated

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
